# Recipes
It's always hard to imagine practical uses and best practices based on plain
documentation. In this section you will find some advanced use cases and

The pages on [Project Structure][structure] and [Component
Libraries][libraries] are of special importance. Reading them before starting
any larger *Pyromaniac* project might provide some valuable insights about how
to model your code base.
